Reading and writing are among the most important and fundamental skills of human beings. Automatic recognition (or reading) of handwritten characters has been studied for a long time [1] and obtained great achievements during the past decades [2], [3]. However, the automatic drawing (or writing) of characters has not been studied as much, until the recent advances based on recurrent neural network for generating sequences [4]. In the development of human intelligence, the skills of reading and writing are mutual complementary. Therefore, for the purpose of machine intelligence, it would be interesting to handle them in unified framework. Chinese characters constitute the oldest continuously used system of writing in the world. Moreover, Chinese characters have been widely used (modified or extended) in many Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea, and so on. 

There are more than tens of thousands of different Chinese characters Most of them can be well recognized by most people, however, nowadays, it is becoming more and more difficult for people to write them correctly, due to the overuse of keyboard or touchscreen based input methods. Compared with reading, writing of Chinese characters is gradually becoming a forgotten or missing skill.

阅读和写作是人类最重要和最基本的技能之一。手写字符的自动识别（或读取）已经研究了很长时间[1]，并在过去的几十年中取得了巨大的成就[2]，[3]。然而，字符的自动绘制（或书写）还没有得到足够的研究，直到最近基于递归神经网络生成序列的进展[4]。在人类智力的发展过程中，阅读和写作技能是相辅相成的。因此，为了机器智能的目的，在统一的框架中处理它们是很有趣的。汉字是世界上最古老的持续使用的书写系统。此外，汉字在中国、日本、韩国等许多亚洲国家被广泛使用（修改或扩展）。

中国有成千上万种不同的汉字，大多数汉字都能被大多数人很好地识别。然而，如今，由于键盘或触摸屏输入法的过度使用，人们要正确书写汉字变得越来越困难。与阅读相比，汉字书写正逐渐成为一种被遗忘或缺失的技能
